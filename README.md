# E-commerce API with Express, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Mongoose

## Description

This project is a RESTful API designed for managing products and orders in an e-commerce platform. It’s built using **Express** and **TypeScript** for backend development, with **MongoDB** for database storage, integrated through **Mongoose**. Data validation is handled using **Zod** or **Joi** to ensure data integrity. The API allows full CRUD operations for both products and orders and provides inventory management.

## Features

- **Product Management**: Create, read, update, and delete products.
- **Order Management**: Place orders, view all or specific orders.
- **Inventory Management**: Automatically update product stock when orders are placed.
- **Validation**: Input validation with **Zod**/**Joi**.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error responses for insufficient stock and invalid data.

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git

   cd repo-name
